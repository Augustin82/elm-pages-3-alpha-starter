# README

This is a starter to try the elm-pages 3.0 alpha. Any feedback would be very helpful for getting the release ready to go!

You can clone this repo with `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-pages-3-alpha-starter.git`.

Check out [the 3.0 Package Docs](https://elm-doc-preview.netlify.app/?repo=dillonkearns%2Felm-pages&version=serverless-latest). The 3.0 docs are still a work in progress. As part of the final release, I will be going through and filling in documentation and updating missing docs. Feel free to make a pull request to update or add docs, or share feedback on the APIs and naming.
